# Neon in IntelliJ IDEA / PhpStorm

**Current status: stable, basic functions**

[Neon](http://ne-on.org/) is a YAML-like language useful for configuration. It is part of [Nette framework](http://nette.org)
 and it's very nice! You should definitely use it.

This plugin aims to add supports for this language into PhpStorm (or the whole IntelliJ platform).

## Features
* lexer, parser (internal)
* syntax highlighting
* comment/uncomment
* bracket / parenthesis matching
* code completion
* ... more to come


## Install
Open project in *IntelliJ IDEA* as a *Plugin project*, go to *Build* -> *Prepare for deployment* and install in your PHP Storm.
Experimental build available [here](http://juzna.cz/intellij-neon.jar). When it reaches a stable state, it'll be available in plugin repository.


## Development
This plugin is in its early development phase, it's not complete at all and it will contain many bugs!
 Be careful if you decide to use it.

Please tell me what **features** you'd like in *Issues tab*.
